> **Note on routing for this set.** Standing operator instruction

## Session 1: Rename `ai-router/` → `ai_router/`, add `pyproject.toml`

### Recommended orchestrator
claude-code claude-opus-4-7 @ effort=high

### Rationale
The work is mechanical-but-broad: a directory rename plus
forward-looking path-string updates across ~30–40 forward-facing
tracked files (instruction files, the workflow doc, the README, a
handful of planning docs, the scripts/verify_session_*.py importlib
shim, a few TS sources, the verifier prompt template, the
session-state schema example doc, plus internal Python references
inside the renamed package). Authoring `pyproject.toml` to the modern
PEP 621 schema and wiring `[project.scripts]` for the seven existing
CLI surfaces requires careful attention to entry points but no
architectural reasoning. Opus at high effort handles the
careful-wording demand on the prose updates and the test-suite
re-run cleanly; Sonnet at medium effort would also suffice for the
mechanical surface but the prose-quality bar in the agent-instruction
files and the workflow doc tips the call to Opus.

### Estimated routed cost
None this session — only end-of-session verification routes (per the
standing operator constraint).

| Step | Action | Routing Decision |
|------|--------|------------------|
| 1 | Read prerequisites (spec, current `ai-router/` layout, `pytest.ini`, agent files) | Direct (orchestrator) |
| 2 | Register Session 1 start (write `session-state.json`) | Direct (file-write helper, no API call) |
| 3 | Author this `ai-assignment.md` | Direct (router suspended per operator) |
| 4 | `git mv ai-router ai_router` | Direct (shell command) |
| 5 | Update `pytest.ini` testpaths | Direct (mechanical edit) |
| 6 | Update internal references inside the renamed `ai_router/` (Python files, docs, schemas, config) | Direct (mechanical find-and-replace) |
| 7 | Update `CLAUDE.md`, `AGENTS.md`, `GEMINI.md` path references | Direct (mechanical edit) |
| 8 | Update `README.md` file map + forward-looking path references in adoption section | Direct (mechanical edit; full collapse of adoption section is Session 3 work) |
| 9 | Update `docs/ai-led-session-workflow.md` path references and the importlib-shim block | Direct (mechanical edit) |
| 10 | Update `docs/planning/repo-worktree-layout.md` and `docs/planning/lessons-learned.md` path references | Direct (mechanical edit) |
| 11 | Update `docs/session-state-schema-example.md` path references | Direct (mechanical edit) |
| 12 | Update `scripts/verify_session_*.py` to use `ai_router` (drop importlib shim where possible) | Direct (mechanical edit) |
| 13 | Update `tools/dabbler-ai-orchestration` TypeScript sources + README path references | Direct (mechanical edit) |
| 14 | Author `pyproject.toml` at repo root (PEP 621 schema, `[project.scripts]` for 7 CLIs) | Direct (mechanical authoring against spec) |
| 15 | Smoke test: `pip install -e .` in fresh venv + `python -c "import ai_router"` | Direct (shell command) |
| 16 | Run full pytest suite (target: 676 passing → 676 passing) | Direct (shell command) |
| 17 | End-of-session cross-provider verification | Routed: `route(task_type="session-verification")` — the only API call this session |
| 18 | Commit, push, run `close_session.py` and stamp Session 1 closed | Direct (CLI invocation) |

**Next-session orchestrator recommendation (Session 2):**
claude-code claude-opus-4-7 @ effort=high
Rationale: Authoring a GitHub Actions release workflow with OIDC
trusted-publishing semantics + the release-process documentation is
small in line-count but high-stakes (a wrong matrix or a missing
`id-token: write` permission breaks the publish path). Opus at high
effort matches the careful-wording demand for the workflow YAML and
the per-release runbook prose. Sonnet at medium effort would also be
viable; bias toward Opus until the workflow has shipped at least one
successful release.
