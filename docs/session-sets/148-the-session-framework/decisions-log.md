# Decisions log — 148-the-session-framework

Every decision, human or AI, in order, with who made it and what it was.

**Kept by hand until session 5.** The writer that owns this file does not
exist yet; session 5 builds it and backfills these entries through it. The
shape here anticipates that writer — date, who, decision, why — so the
backfill is a transcription rather than a re-interpretation.

## Session 1 — Verify the design before anything is built

### D1 · 2026-08-26 · Operator · Set 148 runs on `master`

The set spec left the branch open and named it something every session
inherits. The design documents sat on `design/solution-decomposition`;
`AGENTS.md` named `experiment/verification-pipeline-v3`; the standing
directive is trunk-based work on `master`.

**Chosen: `master`**, per the standing directive and the set spec's own
recommendation.

`master` was a strict ancestor of both branches, so it fast-forwarded to
the design tip and then merged the experiment tip. Nothing was rebased and
no published history was rewritten.

### D2 · 2026-08-26 · Operator · Sets 145 and 146 were already cancelled, on another branch

The set spec named a blocking precondition: set 145 `step-execution` was
`in-progress` and set 146 `measure-then-enable` had never been started, so
the lowest-numbered-`not-started` rule selected 146 ahead of 148.

Both dispositions already existed in machine-written form in commit
`0cc98b33` on `experiment/verification-pipeline-v3` — `status: cancelled`
with `preCancelStatus` recorded and a `CANCELLED.md` reading "new direction
for extension". They were simply unreachable from the branch the design
documents were authored on.

**Resolved by merge, not by editing a state file.** After the merge, zero
sets are `in-progress` and 148 is the lowest-numbered startable set.

*This is the first live test of ground rule 5 — the machine owns the
record. The precondition was satisfiable two ways, and only one of them
left the record honest.*

### D3 · 2026-08-26 · AI (orchestrator), operator-approved · The design documents are held out of the committed tree until session 1 commits them

Round 1 evidence is `git diff HEAD` plus untracked file contents, and
`facts.py::assemble_evidence` raises `EvidenceEmptyError` when both are
empty — the docstring names this exact case: *"a session that already
committed its work once verified nothing and nearly closed clean."*
`verify` takes no commit-range flag.

The four session-framework documents arrived committed only because they
were authored on a design branch. The build instructions assume the
opposite state: "Do the work — and do not commit yet."

**So the four documents were removed from the committed tree** — content
untouched on disk — and the merge commit was amended to exclude them.
`origin/master` was still at `8be18fb8`, so nothing published was rewritten.

**All four are committed by session 1 at its commit-and-push step.**

*Corrected after round 1, finding 1.* The first version of this decision
held `session-framework-build-instructions.md` and this set's `spec.md`
back as session 2's work product. That is unbuildable: `spec.md` is not in
`gates.py::_SET_BOOKKEEPING_BASENAMES` — which is only
`activity-log.json`, `change-log.md`, `session-state.json` and the
lifecycle lock — so `check_working_tree_clean` counts it as an uncommitted
change and session 1 could never have closed. The verifier caught a real
contradiction between a decision recorded here and a gate in running code.

### D4 · 2026-08-26 · AI (orchestrator) · `AGENTS.md` now names `master` as the working branch

D1 made the existing "Working branch" section wrong, and it is the section
every engine reads first. Left stale it would have sent session 2 to
`experiment/verification-pipeline-v3`.

Edited in the unmanaged region above the `dabbler:managed` fence; the
managed body is untouched and still belongs to `ai_router.bootstrap`.

### D5 · 2026-08-26 · Framework · No preverify record is required for this session

`ai_router.affected` reported `no tests affected by this change set`, and
`affected.py::preverify_gate` passes closed-form in that case: *"Declared
to affect no test: nothing to prove, and nothing to ask for."*

Consistent with the set spec's "Est. 0 tests — this session writes no
code." Recorded rather than assumed, because a session that skips a
lifecycle step must be able to show why the step was satisfied.

### D6 · 2026-08-26 · AI (orchestrator) · A redacted read can manufacture a confident false finding — and did, in round 1

Round 1's second finding said `_call_openai` sends `Authorization: ******`
without using the resolved key, so every OpenAI direct-API call would fail
to authenticate. It was Major, specific, and wrong.

The source builds the header correctly. What the verifier read was a
*redacted* view: the secret-scrubbing layer rewrites the text following
the bearer scheme, so a correct `f"Bearer {api_key}"` is presented as a
hardcoded placeholder. The same substitution appeared in the orchestrator's
own tool output while investigating — including inside a diagnostic string
that merely contained the word, which is what identified the mechanism.

Proof taken without printing anything sensitive: the source contains no
asterisk placeholder, the interpolation of the resolved variable matches,
and no `sk-` literal is present. Anthropic and Gemini pass `api_key` in
their own headers and are unaffected.

**Design input for session 6, which builds the verifier's read surface
(spec §4).** Scope, budget and a log do not make a read *faithful*. A
verifier that reads through a transform can reach a blocking finding about
code that does not exist, and the agency log would faithfully record that
it looked at the right file. Either the surface reads unredacted, or a
transformed read is marked as transformed so a finding resting on it can
be weighed — an unmarked one is indistinguishable from evidence.

*This is gap 1 in a form the specification does not currently anticipate:
not "a verifier that cannot look", but a verifier that looked and was shown
something else.*

### D7 · 2026-08-26 · AI (orchestrator) · Session 2 must edit before it verifies

D3 commits all four documents in session 1, so session 2 opens against a
clean tree and would hit the same `EvidenceEmptyError`.

Session 2 has real work that produces a diff — reconciling the session list
against the verified spec and plan, confirming the session 14 reordering,
and appending to this log. **It must make those edits before running
`verify`, not after.** A session whose product is a judgment about an
existing document has to write the judgment down before the judgment can be
reviewed.


### D8 · 2026-08-26 · Verifier (gpt-5.5/openai) · Round 2 withdrew the disputed finding and accepted the D3 correction

Round 2 verdict: **VERIFIED**, no blocking defects.

> "D3 now commits all four non-bookkeeping documents before close, matching
> the clean-tree gate's bookkeeping exception list, and the disputed OpenAI
> auth finding should be withdrawn because the displayed `Authorization`
> text is redacted."

**The dispute channel did the job it exists for.** A Major finding that was
specific, plausible and wrong was withdrawn on evidence rather than argued
down in prose — and no correct code was changed to appease it. Had the
finding been remediated instead of disputed, session 1 would have "fixed" a
working credential path.

*Both halves of the round-1 result were useful: a genuine contradiction the
orchestrator had written into its own plan, and a false positive that
exposed a defect in the verifier's read surface. Neither would have been
found by the author alone.*

### D9 · 2026-08-26 · AI (orchestrator) · The run of record exposed a test that cannot pass on Windows

The first `final-full` run came back **1 failed, 758 passed**:
`tests/test_offline_transport.py::TestSelection::test_config_supplies_the_directory`
asserted `str(resolved) == "/scripts"`, and `str(Path("/scripts"))` renders
as `\scripts` on Windows — the declared primary platform.

**Pre-existing, and not caused by this session**, which until that point had
changed only documents. `resolve_responses_dir` is correct: it returns
`Path(...).expanduser()`, and the assertion was testing the separator
convention of the host rather than the resolution.

Fixed by comparing paths instead of rendered strings — the pattern its own
sibling `test_env_var_beats_config` already uses (`resolved == tmp_path`).
No behaviour changed and no test was added.

**A failed run of record is not reusable proof**, so the suite was re-run
after the fix rather than recorded with a known failure and an explanation.
That rule is why this was found at all: a session permitted to record
"1 failed, and here is why" would have shipped it.

*The set spec estimates 0 tests for this session. That estimate held —
this is a repair to an existing test, not a new one, and the Python test
count is unchanged.*

## Seat cost

The set spec makes session 3 the unit of measurement, because it is the
first ordinary code session. Session 1 is prose review and is recorded here
for contrast rather than as the planning number.

| Session | Rounds | Verifier | Transport | Findings | Cost |
| --- | ---: | --- | --- | ---: | --- |
| 1 | 2 | `gpt-5.5` / openai | `copilot-cli` | 2 Major → 1 remediated, 1 withdrawn | `costUsd: null` |

**`costUsd: null` on a seat call is a metrics gap, not a free call.** Both
rounds recorded null cost and null token counts, which is the seat's known
reporting behaviour (spec §7: seat spend is not attributable per session and
is not estimated). Two rounds of prose review is the observation session 3
will be compared against.

*Round 1 cost two blocking findings' worth of review; round 2 cost a
delta-only read. A session that disputes rather than remediates still pays
for a round — the saving is in not corrupting the code, not in seat spend.*
