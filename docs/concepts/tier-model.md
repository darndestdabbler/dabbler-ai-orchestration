## The one-sentence model

**The only thing the tier changes is the AI router — i.e. whether the
project makes external, metered LLM API calls. `tier: lightweight` flips
`--no-router` (zero API calls); everything else about a Dabbler project is
identical across both tiers.**

Said the other way, and worth memorizing because it is the exact fact four
setup surfaces used to get wrong:

> **Lightweight is router-off, not Python-off.**

Both tiers install Python and `dabbler-ai-router`, run `start_session` and
`close_session`, use the blessed state-file writer, derive session state the
same way, and pass through the same close-out gate. The router is the *only*
moving part the tier switches off.

---

## What is the same on both tiers

Everything in this list is identical whether the project is `full` or
`lightweight`:

| Surface | Both tiers |
|---|---|
| **Python environment** | A `.venv` and `pip install dabbler-ai-router`. |
| **Lifecycle CLIs** | `python -m ai_router.start_session` / `close_session` at every session boundary. |
| **State file** | `session-state.json` (schemaVersion 4), written only by the blessed writer; never hand-edited on a path that has the CLI. |
| **State derivation** | The same `completedSessions[]` / events-ledger derivation and the same seven-state model. |
| **Close-out gate** | The same `close_session` gate (disposition required, `change-log.md` on the final session, idempotent writes). |
| **Engine files** | All three — `CLAUDE.md`, `AGENTS.md`, `GEMINI.md` — because the next session's orchestrator may be a different engine. |
| **Cold-start operative doc** | `docs/dabbler/start-here.md` (generated, never hand-edited). |
| **Spec shape** | One canonical `spec.md` template (schemaVersion 4, `NNN-` slug, required `tier`; Lightweight sets also declare `verificationMode` — Full-tier specs omit the field entirely, Set 082). |
| **Session Set Explorer** | Same activity-bar view, same bucket transitions, same per-session orchestrator block. |
| **Folder layout** | Same `docs/session-sets/<slug>/` artifact set. |

If you find a setup step, doc, or setup-form branch that asks a Lightweight
project to *skip* one of these, that is the drift — fix it against this
table.

## What the tier changes (the only divergence)

There is exactly **one** intentional divergence, and it has two faces — one
at setup time, one at verification time.

### 1. Setup: router config is Full-only

- **Full** writes router config (`ai_router/router-config.yaml`, and a
  `budget.yaml` if the operator sets a verification budget).
- **Lightweight** writes **no** router config. The single declarative switch
  is `tier: lightweight` in the active `spec.md`. That one field is what
  `runtime_mode.py` reads to enter `--no-router` mode.

Everything else the scaffolder writes (the `.venv`, the package install, the
three engine files, `start-here.md`, the templated `spec.md`) is identical.

### 2. Verification: who/what reviews the session's work

- **Full** runs the router-backed, rule-based **cross-provider
  verification** command on **every session — mandatory, no skip** (a model
  from a *different* provider reviews the work; the verdict is recorded;
  issues are remediated; the close gate refuses an unverified close).
- **Lightweight** makes **zero metered API calls**, so the router cannot
  auto-verify. Verification on Lightweight is **per-set, not per-session**,
  and follows the `verificationMode` chosen once at set start (Set 057;
  a completed Mode-A set can opt in later through the sanctioned A→B
  blessed writer `python -m ai_router.change_verification_mode`,
  Set 062):
  - **`out-of-band-or-none`** (the default) — the operator pastes a copyable
    review prompt into a *different* path-aware AI assistant and records the
    verdict by hand in `external-verification.md`, **or** opts out entirely
    for explicit reasons. Strictly opt-in cross-provider review.
  - **`dedicated-sessions`** — a structured **typed-session** flow: a blessed
    verification session run on a different engine, an optional remediation
    session, a bounded re-verification loop, and a content-aware close-out
    gate that confirms a different-engine verification ran.

  See [`docs/ai-led-session-workflow.md`](../ai-led-session-workflow.md)
  → *Lightweight tier — verification* for the full flow, and
  [`docs/spec-md-schema.md`](../spec-md-schema.md) for where `verificationMode`
  is declared and how it is recorded.

That is the whole divergence. Two faces, one root cause: the router is off.

---

## How the tier is resolved at runtime

`runtime_mode.py` resolves `--no-router` mode **once at process start** from
four precedence-ordered sources (highest wins):

1. **CLI flag `--no-router`** — one-off override on any router CLI.
2. **Env var `DABBLER_NO_ROUTER`** — truthy values `1` / `true` / `yes` /
   `on` (case-insensitive); a CI- or shell-session-wide default.
3. **`tier: lightweight` in the active `spec.md`** — the declarative,
   per-set default. **This is the normal switch.**
4. **Default** — full mode (router enabled).

When a higher-precedence source overrides a lower one (for example,
`--no-router` on a `tier: full` spec), the resolver logs an informational
line naming the source that won. There is no refusal — explicit overrides
always win.

Two consequences worth internalizing:

- **`tier:` lives in `spec.md`, and nowhere else is authoritative.** No new
  per-tier state is persisted. The runtime reads the field; that is the
  mechanism.
- Because the tier is read per-set from the active spec, a single repo can
  hold Full sets and Lightweight sets side by side. The tier is a property of
  the *set*, not the *repo*.

## Why this doc exists (the drift it kills)

A human scaffolded a new **Lightweight** consumer repo and was left stuck: no
engine files, no `.venv`, generated specs missing the `tier:` field, and no
clear next step. The root cause was a **stale, pre-Set-048 tier model** that
four setup surfaces still encoded:

<!-- drift-guard:allow-begin (this blockquote quotes the banned framing in order to ban it) -->
> ❌ "Lightweight = no Python, no venv, no close-out machinery, no
> cross-provider verification — just a docs/Explorer-only workflow."
<!-- drift-guard:allow-end -->

That framing is **wrong** and contradicts the implemented `--no-router` mode.
The pure-docs Lightweight tier was an illusion that the Set 048 runtime had
already replaced. This SSoT is the corrected model; the four surfaces
(`adoption-bootstrap.md` — since retired to a deprecation stub in Set 063 —
the Getting Started form, `sessionGenPrompt`, `gitScaffold`) now
point here, and a CI guard forbids the stale phrasing from reappearing in any
doc.

**Banned framing — never write any of these about Lightweight:**

<!-- drift-guard:allow-begin (this list IS the banned-phrase catalogue the CI guard enforces) -->
- "no Python" / "no `.venv`" / "no venv"
- "no `ai_router` / no PyPI dependency"
- "no close-out" / "no `start_session` / `close_session`"
- "docs-only" / "Explorer-only" as the *definition* of the tier
<!-- drift-guard:allow-end -->

**Correct framing — always:** *router-off, not Python-off; `tier:` is the
single switch; both tiers share the Python lifecycle.*

> A CI drift guard (`ai_router/scripts/drift_guard.py`, Set 058 S3) scans all
> live guidance docs for the banned phrasing above and fails the build if it
> reappears outside an explicit `<!-- drift-guard:allow-begin/end -->` region.

## Choosing a tier (one question)

Pick the tier by answering one question: **do you want this project's
sessions verified by an automatic, metered, cross-provider API call at the
end of each session?**

- **Yes, and I'm fine paying per-call for it** → **Full.** You also get
  cost-minded routing of reasoning tasks and automatic metrics.
- **No — I'd rather make zero metered calls and verify out-of-band (or via a
  dedicated different-engine verification session), or not at all** →
  **Lightweight.**

Everything else is the same. You can move a set from Lightweight to Full by
flipping `tier:` in its `spec.md` and adding router config; nothing else has
to change.

## The Full tier seat-profile option (Copilot-only shops)

For organizations that cannot hold direct provider API keys (`DABBLER_*` env
vars) under corporate policy but do have GitHub Copilot subscriptions, Full
offers a **seat profile** (Set 078): `route()`/`verify()` keep every part of
Full — task typing, tiering, cross-provider verification, metrics — but
dispatch each call through the GitHub Copilot CLI's headless mode instead of
a direct provider HTTPS API. This gives a Copilot-seat-only shop an
*indirect* Full tier: work generated under one underlying model provider,
independently verified under a different one, inside a single subscription.

This is presented honestly as **Full-compatible with explicitly degraded
guarantees** — never as byte-equivalent to the direct-API Full tier:

- **Provider provenance is asserted, not confirmed.** The Copilot CLI has no
  model-discovery command or first-party `provider` field, so provenance is
  derived from a model-name-prefix heuristic (`claude-*` / `gpt-*` /
  `gemini-*`) recorded in a seat-local catalog, not read off an API.
- **A seat's identity is its underlying model, and the seat must declare it
  (Set 084 F1).** A Copilot seat relays whatever model the picker selected, so
  the seat *label* is never an identity. `start_session` **refuses** a Copilot
  start (`--engine github-copilot` / `copilot`) without a registry-known
  `--model` and records `identityProvenance: asserted` (vs. `direct` for
  single-vendor engines). Every downstream identity consumer — the
  verification-integrity close gate and verifier selection — derives the
  **effective provider** by registry lookup on that model, never from the
  free-text `--provider` label. Verifier selection then **excludes** that
  effective provider (applied against the seat's catalog lockfile), so a seat
  can never verify its own work under the same provider. If the seat's catalog
  serves no different-provider verifier, the session yields
  **`verification_unavailable`** — a hard blocked state (no verdict written),
  resolvable only by the operator-attested `--manual-verify` path, never a
  silent same-provider pass. And a Full-tier close that arrives unverified runs
  the **close backstop** (Set 084): `close_session` performs the verification
  itself in-process through the same exclusion, so the seat's orchestrator never
  holds the last word.
- **Seat billing is not locally meterable.** The only usage signal is a
  per-call count (`result.usage.premiumRequests`) — no token cost, no dollar
  figure, no remaining balance. Cost-keyed guards (dollar/token budgets,
  price-table estimators, quota/balance preflights) are excluded under this
  profile and the skip is always logged; a hard, non-cost-keyed circuit
  breaker (`transport.max_invocations_per_session`, default 200) caps seat
  burn instead.

**Activation (guided, the primary path — Set 079):** use the VS Code
extension's Getting Started form. In step 1, choosing the **Full** tier
surfaces a "Provider access (how routed calls run)" choice: **Direct
provider API keys** (the default) or **GitHub Copilot CLI seat**.
Selecting the seat option automates the setup: after the standard
project scaffold succeeds, the form runs the seat's catalog refresh
(`python -m ai_router.copilot_catalog --refresh`, invoked with the
scaffolded `.venv`'s own interpreter and an auto-derived seat id/label —
zero typing) as a cancellable progress notification, parses the
refresh's actual confirmed-provider result rather than its exit code,
and only when the seat confirms at least two distinct provider families
renders `transport.profile: copilot-cli` into
`ai_router/router-config.yaml`. If seat setup fails and no `DABBLER_*`
key is present, the form says plainly that the scaffold completed but
the router is **not yet functional**, with reason-specific guidance and
the re-run command (re-run the refresh from the scaffolded `.venv`; no
re-scaffold is needed). `api` is offered as a working fallback only
when `DABBLER_*` keys are actually present.

**Activation (manual, the fallback path):** set `transport.profile:
copilot-cli` in `ai_router/router-config.yaml` (default is `api`, the
unchanged direct-HTTPS path) and build the seat's local model catalog —
run `python -m ai_router.copilot_catalog --refresh` to discover the
seat's dispatchable models and write `ai_router/copilot-catalog.lock`.
On either path, every routed call validates the lockfile against the
live CLI and fails closed on version drift, missing provenance, or
fewer than two distinct providers among confirmed entries.

**Evidence basis:** validated end-to-end (design lock, live dogfood, UAT
attestation) on a single operator's personal Copilot seat — Set 078 for
the transport itself, and Set 079's live dogfood of the guided form ran
on that **same** personal seat. Neither set validates multi-seat or
enterprise-seat model availability: an enterprise-locked seat may expose
only one provider family, which fails the ≥2-provider check even though
the guided flow itself "worked", and whether a given team seat confirms
two distinct providers is unknown until someone on that team actually
runs the flow. A second, representative target-team seat and a GitHub
Models enterprise-availability check were never completed and were
dropped as a gate requirement by an explicit, recorded operator override
rather than proven — see
`docs/session-sets/078-copilot-cli-hybrid-tier/s1-cli-contract.md`.
Two further recorded limits from Set 079's induced-failure dogfood: the
POSIX process-tree kill on cancel is unit-tested but has not yet been
exercised against a live POSIX process tree (the dogfood host was
Windows), and the config write is atomic against process crash only —
it makes no power-loss durability claim.

**Choose this profile when:** staff are corporate-policy-locked to Copilot
seats only, no `DABBLER_*` key is possible, and Full's cross-provider
verification guarantee (even in its degraded, seat-asserted form) is worth
more than the honest gaps above. Otherwise, a keyed shop should use the
direct-API `api` profile (the default), and a Copilot-locked shop that does
not need Full's guarantees should consider Lightweight's Mode B
(`dedicated-sessions`) provider-picker pattern instead.
